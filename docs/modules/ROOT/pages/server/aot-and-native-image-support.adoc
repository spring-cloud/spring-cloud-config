=  AOT and Native Image Support
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Since `4.0.0`, Spring Cloud Config Server supports Spring AOT transformations. As of `4.1.0` it also supports GraalVM native images, however it requires the user to add some workarounds for known GraalVM issues, as described below.

====

IMPORTANT::
Due to [a bug](https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/5134) in Graal's `FileSystemProvider` a configuration workaround needs to be added to allow the Config Server to run as a native image.  You will need to add the following options to your GraalVM build plugin setup (please refer to https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] Maven or Gradle plugin documentation for more details):

[source,indent=0]
----
-H:-AddAllFileSystemProviders
--strict-image-heap
--initialize-at-build-time=org.bouncycastle
--initialize-at-build-time=net.i2p.crypto.eddsa.EdDSASecurityProvider
--initialize-at-run-time=org.bouncycastle.jcajce.provider.drbg.DRBG$Default
--initialize-at-run-time=org.bouncycastle.jcajce.provider.drbg.DRBG$NonceAndIV
----

NOTE:: Adding the additional build time initializations can affect performance, but it still may offer gains as compared to a regular JVM run. Make sure to measure and compare for your application.

====

TIP::
If you are connecting with your config data backend over SSH, keep in mind that GraalVM requires https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/dynamic-features/JCASecurityServices/#provider-registration[security provider registration using `java.security`]

WARNING: Refresh scope is not supported with native images. If you are going to run your config client application as a native image, make sure to set `spring.cloud.refresh.enabled` property to `false`.
