= Encryption and Decryption

IMPORTANT: To use the encryption and decryption features you need the full-strength JCE installed in your JVM (it is not included by default).
You can download the "`Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files`" from Oracle and follow the installation instructions (essentially, you need to replace the two policy files in the JRE lib/security directory with the ones that you downloaded). This is only applicable for old versions of Java. Starting from Java 9, and definitively from Java 8u161 onwards, unlimited strength cryptography is enabled by default

If the remote property sources contain encrypted content (values starting with `\{cipher}`), they are decrypted before sending to clients over HTTP.
The main advantage of this setup is that the property values need not be in plain text when they are "`at rest`" (for example, in a git repository).
If a value cannot be decrypted, it is removed from the property source and an additional property is added with the same key but prefixed with `invalid` and a value that means "`not applicable`" (usually `<n/a>`).
This is largely to prevent cipher text being used as a password and accidentally leaking.

If you set up a remote config repository for config client applications, it might contain an `application.yml` similar to the following:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  datasource:
    username: dbuser
    password: '{cipher}FKSAJDFGYOS8F7GLHAKERGFHLSAJ'
----

Encrypted values in `application.properties` file must not be wrapped in quotes. Otherwise, the value is not decrypted. The following example shows values that would work:

.application.properties
----
spring.datasource.username: dbuser
spring.datasource.password: {cipher}FKSAJDFGYOS8F7GLHAKERGFHLSAJ
----

You can safely push this plain text to a shared git repository, and the secret password remains protected.

The server also exposes `/encrypt` and `/decrypt` endpoints (on the assumption that these are secured and only accessed by authorized agents).
If you edit a remote config file, you can use the Config Server to encrypt values by POSTing to the `/encrypt` endpoint, as shown in the following example:

----
$ curl localhost:8888/encrypt -s -d mysecret
682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
----

TIP: If you are testing with curl, then use `--data-urlencode` (instead of `-d`) and prefix the value to encrypt with `=` (curl requires this) or set an explicit `Content-Type: text/plain` to make sure curl encodes the data correctly when there are special characters ('+' is particularly tricky).

TIP: Be sure not to include any of the curl command statistics in the encrypted value, this is why the examples use the `-s` option to silence them. Outputting the value to a file can help avoid this problem.

The inverse operation is also available through `/decrypt` (provided the server is
configured with a symmetric key or a full key pair), as shown in the following example:

----
$ curl localhost:8888/decrypt -s -d 682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
mysecret
----

Take the encrypted value and add the `\{cipher}` prefix before you put it in the YAML or properties file and before you commit and push it to a remote (potentially insecure) store.

The `/encrypt` and `/decrypt` endpoints also both accept paths in the form of `/*/\{application}/\{profiles}`, which can be used to control cryptography on a per-application (name) and per-profile basis when clients call into the main environment resource.

NOTE: To control the cryptography in this granular way, you must also provide a `@Bean` of type `TextEncryptorLocator` that creates a different encryptor per name and profiles.
The one that is provided by default does not do so (all encryptions use the same key).

The `spring` command line client (with Spring Cloud CLI extensions
installed) can also be used to encrypt and decrypt, as shown in the following example:

----
$ spring encrypt mysecret --key foo
682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
$ spring decrypt --key foo 682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
mysecret
----

To use a key in a file (such as an RSA public key for encryption), prepend
the key value with "@" and provide the file path, as shown in the following example:

----
$ spring encrypt mysecret --key @${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
AQAjPgt3eFZQXwt8tsHAVv/QHiY5sI2dRcR+...
----

NOTE: The `--key` argument is mandatory (despite having a `--` prefix).

== Decryption Errors

When the config server fails to decrypt a value it will create an `invalid` property in the HTTP response.

For example

[source,json]
----
{
    "label": null,
    "name": "application",
    "profiles": [
        "prd"
    ],
    "propertySources": [
        {
            "name": "file:/demo/configserver/application-prd.yaml",
            "source": {
                "invalid.SharedPassword": "<n/a>"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "file:/demo/configserver/application.yaml",
            "source": {
                "SharedPassword": "Fill_me_in"
            }
        }
    ],
    "state": null,
    "version": null
}

----

In the example above the config server could not decrypt the value of `SharedPassword` in `application-prd.yaml`
so the config server prefixed the property name with `invalid`.

If this response was received by the Config Client and then added to the app's `Environment` and the client
requested the value of `SharedPassword` it would get `Fill_me_in`.

If you do not want the config server to prefix properties it can't decrypt wit `invalid` then you can set
`spring.cloud.config.server.encrypt.prefix-invalid-properties` to `false`.  If you do this then the same response from
the config server would look like this:

[source,json]
----
    "label": null,
    "name": "application",
    "profiles": [
        "prd"
    ],
    "propertySources": [
        {
            "name": "file:/demo/configserver/application-prd.yaml",
            "source": {
                "SharedPassword": "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"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "file:/demo/configserver/application.yaml",
            "source": {
                "SharedPassword": "Fill_me_in"
            }
        }
    ],
    "state": null,
    "version": null
}
----

In this case if the config client were to receive the above response and requested that value
of `SharedPassword` from the `Environment` it would get the encrypted value back instead of
`Fill_me_in`.
