[[git-backend]]
= Git Backend

The default implementation of `EnvironmentRepository` uses a Git backend, which is very convenient for managing upgrades and physical environments and for auditing changes.
To change the location of the repository, you can set the `spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri` configuration property in the Config Server (for example in `application.yml`).
If you set it with a `file:` prefix, it should work from a local repository so that you can get started quickly and easily without a server. However, in that case, the server operates directly on the local repository without cloning it (it does not matter if it is not bare because the Config Server never makes changes to the "remote" repository).
To scale the Config Server up and make it highly available, you need to have all instances of the server pointing to the same repository, so only a shared file system would work.
Even in that case, it is better to use the `ssh:` protocol for a shared filesystem repository, so that the server can clone it and use a local working copy as a cache.

This repository implementation maps the `\{label}` parameter of the HTTP resource to a git label (commit id, branch name, or tag).
If the git branch or tag name contains a slash (`/`), then the label in the HTTP URL should instead be specified with the special string `(\{special-string})` (to avoid ambiguity with other URL paths).
For example, if the label is `foo/bar`, replacing the slash would result in the following label: `foo(\{special-string})bar`.
The inclusion of the special string `(\{special-string})` can also be applied to the `\{application}` parameter.
If you use a command-line client such as curl, be careful with the brackets in the URL -- you should escape them from the shell with single quotes ('').

[[skipping-ssl-certificate-validation]]
== Skipping SSL Certificate Validation

The configuration server's validation of the Git server's SSL certificate can be disabled by setting the `git.skipSslValidation` property to `true` (default is `false`).

----

[[setting-connection-timeout]]
== Setting Connection Timeout

You can configure the time, in seconds, that the configuration server will wait to acquire an HTTP or SSH connection. Use the `git.timeout` property (default is `5`).

      server:
        git:
          uri: https://example.com/my/repo
          timeout: 4
----

[[placeholders-in-git-uri]]
== Placeholders in Git URI

Spring Cloud Config Server supports a git repository URL with placeholders for the `\{application}` and `\{profile}` (and `\{label}` if you need it, but remember that the label is applied as a git label anyway).
So you can support a "`one repository per application`" policy by using a structure similar to the following:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/myorg/\{application}
----

You can also support a "`one repository per profile`" policy by using a similar pattern but with
`\{profile}`.

Additionally, using the special string "(\{special-string})" within your `\{application}` parameters can enable support for multiple
organizations, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/\{application}
----

where `\{application}` is provided at request time in the following format: `organization(\{special-string})application`.

[[pattern-matching-and-multiple-repositories]]
== Pattern Matching and Multiple Repositories

Spring Cloud Config also includes support for more complex requirements with pattern
matching on the application and profile name.
The pattern format is a comma-separated list of `\{application}/\{profile}` names with wildcards (note that a pattern beginning with a wildcard may need to be quoted), as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          repos:
            simple: https://github.com/simple/config-repo
            special:
              pattern: special*/dev*,*special*/dev*
              uri: https://github.com/special/config-repo
            local:
              pattern: local*
              uri: file:/home/configsvc/config-repo
----

If `\{application}/\{profile}` does not match any of the patterns, it uses the default URI defined under `spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri`.
In the above example, for the "`simple`" repository, the pattern is `simple/\*` (it only matches one application named `simple` in all profiles). The "`local`" repository matches all application names beginning with `local` in all profiles (the `/*` suffix is added automatically to any pattern that does not have a profile matcher).

NOTE: The "`one-liner`" short cut used in the "`simple`" example can be used only if the only property to be set is the URI.
If you need to set anything else (credentials, pattern, and so on) you need to use the full form.

The `pattern` property in the repo is actually an array, so you can use a YAML array (or `[0]`, `[1]`, etc. suffixes in properties files) to bind to multiple patterns.
You may need to do so if you are going to run apps with multiple profiles, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          repos:
            development:
              pattern:
                - '*/development'
                - '*/staging'
              uri: https://github.com/development/config-repo
            staging:
              pattern:
                - '*/qa'
                - '*/production'
              uri: https://github.com/staging/config-repo
----

NOTE: Spring Cloud guesses that a pattern containing a profile that does not end in `\*` implies that you actually want to match a list of profiles starting with this pattern (so `*/staging` is a shortcut for `["\*/staging", "*/staging,*"]`, and so on).
This is common where, for instance, you need to run applications in the "`development`" profile locally but also the "`cloud`" profile remotely.

Every repository can also optionally store config files in sub-directories, and patterns to search for those directories can be specified as `search-paths`.
The following example shows a config file at the top level:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          search-paths:
            - foo
            - bar*
----

In the preceding example, the server searches for config files in the top level and in the `foo/` sub-directory and also any sub-directory whose name begins with `bar`.

By default, the server clones remote repositories when configuration
is first requested.
The server can be configured to clone the repositories at startup, as shown in the following top-level example:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://git/common/config-repo.git
          repos:
            team-a:
                pattern: team-a-*
                cloneOnStart: true
                uri: https://git/team-a/config-repo.git
            team-b:
                pattern: team-b-*
                cloneOnStart: false
                uri: https://git/team-b/config-repo.git
            team-c:
                pattern: team-c-*
                uri: https://git/team-a/config-repo.git

----

In the preceding example, the server clones team-a's config-repo on startup, before it
accepts any requests.
All other repositories are not cloned until configuration from the repository is requested.

NOTE: Setting a repository to be cloned when the Config Server starts up can help to identify a misconfigured configuration source (such as an invalid repository URI) quickly, while the Config Server is starting up.
With `cloneOnStart` not enabled for a configuration source, the Config Server may start successfully with a misconfigured or invalid configuration source and not detect an error until an application requests configuration from that configuration source.

[[authentication]]
== Authentication

To use HTTP basic authentication on the remote repository, add the `username` and `password` properties separately (not in the URL), as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          username: trolley
          password: strongpassword
----

If you do not use HTTPS and user credentials, SSH should also work out of the box when you store keys in the default directories (`~/.ssh`) and the URI points to an SSH location, such as `git@github.com:configuration/cloud-configuration`.
It is important that an entry for the Git server be present in the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file and that it is in `ssh-rsa` format.
Other formats (such as `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`) are not supported.
To avoid surprises, you should ensure that only one entry is present in the `known_hosts` file for the Git server and that it matches the URL you provided to the config server.
If you use a hostname in the URL, you want to have exactly that (not the IP) in the `known_hosts` file.
The repository is accessed by using JGit, so any documentation you find on that should be applicable.
HTTPS proxy settings can be set in `~/.git/config` or (in the same way as for any other JVM process) with
system properties (`-Dhttps.proxyHost` and `-Dhttps.proxyPort`).

TIP: If you do not know where your `~/.git` directory is, use `git config --global` to manipulate the settings (for example, `git config --global http.sslVerify false`).

JGit requires RSA keys in PEM format. Below is an example ssh-keygen (from openssh) command that will generate a key in the corect format:

```bash
ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/config_server_deploy_key.rsa
```

Warning: When working with SSH keys, the expected ssh private-key must begin with ```-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----```. If the key starts with ```-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----``` then the RSA key will not load when spring-cloud-config server is started. The error looks like:
```
- Error in object 'spring.cloud.config.server.git': codes [PrivateKeyIsValid.spring.cloud.config.server.git,PrivateKeyIsValid]; arguments [org.springframework.context.support.DefaultMessageSourceResolvable: codes [spring.cloud.config.server.git.,]; arguments []; default message []]; default message [Property 'spring.cloud.config.server.git.privateKey' is not a valid private key]
```

To correct the above error the RSA key must be converted to PEM format. An example using openssh is provided above for generating a new key in the appropriate format.

[[authentication-with-aws-codecommit]]
== Authentication with AWS CodeCommit

Spring Cloud Config Server also supports https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/welcome.html[AWS CodeCommit] authentication.
AWS CodeCommit uses an authentication helper when using Git from the command line.
This helper is not used with the JGit library, so a JGit CredentialProvider for AWS CodeCommit is created if the Git URI matches the AWS CodeCommit pattern.
AWS CodeCommit URIs follow this pattern:

```bash
https://git-codecommit.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/${repo}
```

If you provide a username and password with an AWS CodeCommit URI, they must be the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html[AWS accessKeyId and secretAccessKey] that provide access to the repository.
If you do not specify a username and password, the accessKeyId and secretAccessKey are retrieved by using the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/credentials.html[Default Credential Provider Chain].

If your Git URI matches the CodeCommit URI pattern (shown earlier), you must provide valid AWS credentials in the username and password or in one of the locations supported by the default credential provider chain.
AWS EC2 instances may use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html[IAM Roles for EC2 Instances].

NOTE: The `software.amazon.awssdk:auth` jar is an optional dependency.
If the `software.amazon.awssdk:auth` jar is not on your classpath, the AWS Code Commit credential provider is not created, regardless of the git server URI.

[[authentication-with-google-cloud-source]]
== Authentication with Google Cloud Source

Spring Cloud Config Server also supports authenticating against https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories/[Google Cloud Source] repositories.

If your Git URI uses the `http` or `https` protocol and the domain name is `source.developers.google.com`, the Google Cloud Source credentials provider will be used. A Google Cloud Source repository URI has the format `https://source.developers.google.com/p/$\{GCP_PROJECT}/r/$\{REPO}`. To obtain the URI for your repository, click on "Clone" in the Google Cloud Source UI, and select "Manually generated credentials". Do not generate any credentials, simply copy the displayed URI.

The Google Cloud Source credentials provider will use Google Cloud Platform application default credentials. See https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login[Google Cloud SDK documentation] on how to create application default credentials for a system. This approach will work for user accounts in dev environments and for service accounts in production environments.

NOTE: `com.google.auth:google-auth-library-oauth2-http` is an optional dependency.
If the `google-auth-library-oauth2-http` jar is not on your classpath, the Google Cloud Source credential provider is not created, regardless of the git server URI.

[[git-ssh-configuration-using-properties]]
== Git SSH configuration using properties

By default, the JGit library used by Spring Cloud Config Server uses SSH configuration files such as `~/.ssh/known_hosts` and `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` when connecting to Git repositories by using an SSH URI.
In cloud environments such as Cloud Foundry, the local filesystem may be ephemeral or not easily accessible.
For those cases, SSH configuration can be set by using Java properties.
In order to activate property-based SSH configuration, the `spring.cloud.config.server.git.ignoreLocalSshSettings` property must be set to `true`, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]

The following table describes the SSH configuration properties.

.SSH Configuration Properties
|===
|Property Name |Remarks

|*ignoreLocalSshSettings*
|If `true`, use property-based instead of file-based SSH config. Must be set at as `spring.cloud.config.server.git.ignoreLocalSshSettings`, *not* inside a repository definition.

|*privateKey*
|Valid SSH private key. Must be set if `ignoreLocalSshSettings` is true and Git URI is SSH format.

|*hostKey*
|Valid SSH host key. Must be set if `hostKeyAlgorithm` is also set.

|*hostKeyAlgorithm*
|One of `ssh-dss, ssh-rsa, ssh-ed25519, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, or ecdsa-sha2-nistp521`. Must be set if `hostKey` is also set.

|*strictHostKeyChecking*
|`true` or `false`. If false, ignore errors with host key.

|*knownHostsFile*
|Location of custom `.known_hosts` file.

[[placeholders-in-git-search-paths]]
== Placeholders in Git Search Paths

Spring Cloud Config Server also supports a search path with placeholders for the `\{application}` and `\{profile}` (and `\{label}` if
you need it), as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          search-paths: '\{application}'
----

The preceding listing causes a search of the repository for files in the same name as the directory (as well as the top level).
Wildcards are also valid in a search path with placeholders (any matching directory is included in the search).

[[force-pull-in-git-repositories]]
== Force pull in Git Repositories

As mentioned earlier, Spring Cloud Config Server makes a clone of the remote git repository in case the local copy gets dirty (for example,
folder content changes by an OS process) such that Spring Cloud Config Server cannot update the local copy from remote repository.

To solve this issue, there is a `force-pull` property that makes Spring Cloud Config Server force pull from the remote repository if the local copy is dirty, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          force-pull: true

----

If you have a multiple-repositories configuration, you can configure the `force-pull` property per repository, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://git/common/config-repo.git
          force-pull: true
          repos:
            team-a:
                pattern: team-a-*
                uri: https://git/team-a/config-repo.git
                force-pull: true
            team-b:
                pattern: team-b-*
                uri: https://git/team-b/config-repo.git
                force-pull: true
            team-c:
                pattern: team-c-*
                uri: https://git/team-a/config-repo.git
----

NOTE: The default value for `force-pull` property is `false`.

[[deleting-untracked-branches-in-git-repositories]]
== Deleting untracked branches in Git Repositories

As Spring Cloud Config Server has a clone of the remote git repository
after check-outing branch to local repo (e.g fetching properties by label) it will keep this branch
forever or till the next server restart (which creates new local repo).
So there could be a case when remote branch is deleted but local copy of it is still available for fetching.
And if Spring Cloud Config Server client service starts with `--spring.cloud.config.label=deletedRemoteBranch,master`
it will fetch properties from `deletedRemoteBranch` local branch, but not from `master`.

In order to keep local repository branches clean and up to remote - `deleteUntrackedBranches` property could be set.
It will make Spring Cloud Config Server *force* delete untracked branches from local repository.
Example:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          deleteUntrackedBranches: true

----

NOTE: The default value for `deleteUntrackedBranches` property is `false`.

[[git-refresh-rate]]
== Git Refresh Rate

You can control how often the config server will fetch updated configuration data
from your Git backend by using `spring.cloud.config.server.git.refreshRate`.  The
value of this property is specified in seconds.  By default the value is 0, meaning
the config server will fetch updated configuration from the Git repo every time it
is requested. If the value is a negative number the refresh will not occur.

[[default-label]]
== Default Label

The default label used for Git is `main`.  If you do not set `spring.cloud.config.server.git.defaultLabel` and a branch named `main`
does not exist, the config server will by default also try to checkout a branch named `master`.  If
you would like to disable to the fallback branch behavior you can set
`spring.cloud.config.server.git.tryMasterBranch` to `false`.
