== Spring Cloud Config Server

The Server provides an HTTP, resource-based API for external
configuration (name-value pairs, or equivalent YAML content).  The
server is easily embeddable in a Spring Boot application using the
`@EnableConfigServer` annotation. So this app is a config server:

.ConfigServer.java
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableConfigServer
public class ConfigServer {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(ConfigServer.class, args);
  }
}
----

Like all Spring Boot apps it runs on port 8080 by default, but you
can switch it to the conventional port 8888 in various ways. The
easiest, which also sets a default configuration repository, 
is by launching it with `spring.config.name=configserver` (there 
is a `configserver.yml` in the Config Server jar). Another is
to use your own `application.properties`, e.g.

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
server.port: 8888
spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri: file://${user.home}/config-repo
----

where `${user.home}/config-repo` is a git repository containing
YAML and properties files.

NOTE: in Windows you need an extra "/" in the file URL if it is 
absolute with a drive prefix, e.g. `file:///${user.home}/config-repo`.

[TIP]
====
Here's a recipe for creating the git repository in the example 
above:

----
$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir config-repo
$ cd config-repo
$ git init .
$ echo info.foo: bar > application.properties
$ git add -A .
$ git commit -m "Add application.properties"
----
====

WARNING: using the local filesystem for your git repository is
intended for testing only. Use a server to host your 
configuration repositories in production.

WARNING: the initial clone of your configuration repository will
be quick and efficient if you only keep text files in it. If you start
to store binary files, especially large ones, you may experience
delays on the first request for configuration and/or out of memory
errors in the server.

=== Environment Repository

Where do you want to store the configuration data for the Config
Server? The strategy that governs this behaviour is the
`EnvironmentRepository`, serving `Environment` objects. This
`Environment` is a shallow copy of the domain from the Spring
`Environment` (including `propertySources` as the main feature). The
`Environment` resources are parametrized by three variables:


* `{application}` maps to "spring.application.name" on the client side;

* `{profile}` maps to "spring.profiles.active" on the client (comma separated list); and 

* `{label}` which is a server side feature labelling a "versioned" set of config files.

Repository implementations generally behave just like a Spring Boot
application loading configuration files from a "spring.config.name"
equal to the `{application}` parameter, and "spring.profiles.active"
equal to the `{profiles}` parameter. Precedence rules for profiles are
also the same as in a regular Boot application: active profiles take
precedence over defaults, and if there are multiple profiles the last
one wins (like adding entries to a `Map`).

Example: a client application has this bootstrap configuration:

.bootstrap.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  application:
    name: foo
  profiles:
    active: dev,mysql
----

(as usual with a Spring Boot application, these properties could also
be set as environment variables or command line arguments). 

If the repository is file-based, the server will create an
`Environment` from `application.yml` (shared between all clients), and
`foo.yml` (with `foo.yml` taking precedence). If the YAML files have
documents inside them that point to Spring profiles, those are applied
with higher precedence (in order of the profiles listed), and if
there are profile-specific YAML (or properties) files these are also
applied with higher precedence than the defaults. Higher precedence
translates to a `PropertySource` listed earlier in the
`Environment`. (These are the same rules as apply in a standalone
Spring Boot application.)

==== Git Backend

The default implementation of `EnvironmentRepository` uses a Git
backend, which is very convenient for managing upgrades and physical
environments, and also for auditing changes. To change the location of
the repository you can set the "spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri"
configuration property in the Config Server (e.g. in
`application.yml`). If you set it with a `file:` prefix it should work
from a local repository so you can get started quickly and easily
without a server, but in that case the server operates directly on the
local repository without cloning it (it doesn't matter if it's not
bare because the Config Server never makes changes to the "remote"
repository). To scale the Config Server up and make it highly
available, you would need to have all instances of the server pointing
to the same repository, so only a shared file system would work. Even
in that case it is better to use the `ssh:` protocol for a shared
filesystem repository, so that the server can clone it and use a local
working copy as a cache.

This repository implementation maps the `{label}` parameter of the
HTTP resource to a git label (commit id, branch name or tag). If the
git branch or tag name contains a slash ("/") then the label in the
HTTP URL should be specified with the special string "(_)" instead (to
avoid ambiguity with other URL paths). Be careful with the brackets in
the URL if you are using a command line client like curl (e.g. escape
them from the shell with quotes '').

===== Placeholders in Git URI

Spring Cloud Config Server supports a git repository URL with
placeholders for the `{application}` and `{profile}` (and `{label}` if
you need it, but remember that the label is applied as a git label
anyway). So you can easily support a "one repo per application" policy
using (for example):

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/myorg/{application}
----

or a "one repo per profile" policy using a similar pattern but with
`{profile}`.

===== Pattern Matching and Multiple Repositories

There is also support for more complex requirements with pattern
matching on the application and profile name. The pattern format is a
comma-separated list of `{application}/{profile}` names with wildcards
(where a pattern beginning with a wildcard may need to be
quoted). Example:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          repos:
            simple: https://github.com/simple/config-repo
            special:
              pattern: special*/dev*,*special*/dev*
              uri: https://github.com/special/config-repo
            local:
              pattern: local*
              uri: file:/home/configsvc/config-repo
----

If `{application}/{profile}` does not match any of the patterns, it
will use the default uri defined under
"spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri". In the above example, for the
"simple" repository, the pattern is `simple/\*` (i.e. it only matches
one application named "simple" in all profiles). The "local"
repository matches all application names beginning with "local" in all
profiles (the `/*` suffix is added automatically to any pattern that
doesn't have a profile matcher).

NOTE: the "one-liner" short cut used in the "simple" example above can
only be used if the only property to be set is the URI. If you need to
set anything else (credentials, pattern, etc.) you need to use the full
form.

The `pattern` property in the repo is actually an array, so you can
use a YAML array (or `[0]`, `[1]`, etc. suffixes in properties files)
to bind to multiple patterns. You may need to do this if you are going
to run apps with multiple profiles. Example:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          repos:
            development:
              pattern:
                - */development
                - */staging
              uri: https://github.com/development/config-repo
            staging:
              pattern:
                - */qa
                - */production
              uri: https://github.com/staging/config-repo
----

NOTE: Spring Cloud will guess that a pattern containing a profile that
doesn't end in `\*` implies that you actually want to match a list of
profiles starting with this pattern (so `*/staging` is a shortcut for
`["\*/staging", "*/staging,*"]`). This is common where you need to run
apps in the "development" profile locally but also the "cloud" profile
remotely, for instance.

Every repository can also optionally store config files in
sub-directories, and patterns to search for those directories can be
specified as `searchPaths`. For example at the top level:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          searchPaths: foo,bar*
----

In this example the server searches for config files in the top level
and in the "foo/" sub-directory and also any sub-directory whose name
begins with "bar".

By default the server clones remote repositories when configuration 
is first requested. The server can be configured to clone the repositories
at startup. For example at the top level:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://git/common/config-repo.git
          repos:
            team-a:
                pattern: team-a-*
                cloneOnStart: true
                uri: http://git/team-a/config-repo.git
            team-b:
                pattern: team-b-*
                cloneOnStart: false
                uri: http://git/team-b/config-repo.git
            team-c:
                pattern: team-c-*
                uri: http://git/team-a/config-repo.git
                
----

In this example the server clones team-a's config-repo on startup before it 
accepts any requests. All other repositories will not be cloned until 
configuration from the repository is requested.

To use HTTP basic authentication on the remote repository add the
"username" and "password" properties separately (not in the URL), 
e.g.

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          username: trolley
          password: strongpassword
----

If you don't use HTTPS and user credentials, SSH should also work out
of the box when you store keys in the default directories (`~/.ssh`)
and the uri points to an SSH location,
e.g. "git@github.com:configuration/cloud-configuration". The
repository is accessed using JGit, so any documentation you find on
that should be applicable. HTTPS proxy settings can be set in
`~/.git/config` or in the same way as for any other JVM process via
system properties (`-Dhttps.proxyHost` and `-Dhttps.proxyPort`).

TIP: If you don't know where your `~/.git` directory is us `git config
--global` to manipulate the settings (e.g. `git config --global
http.sslVerify false`).

===== Placeholders in Git Search Paths

Spring Cloud Config Server also supports a search path with
placeholders for the `{application}` and `{profile}` (and `{label}` if
you need it). Example:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          searchPaths: '{application}'
----

searches the repository for files in the same name as the directory
(as well as the top level). Wildcards are also valid in a search 
path with placeholders (any matching directory is included in the 
search).

==== Version Control Backend Filesystem Use

WARNING: With VCS based backends (git, svn) files are checked out or cloned to the local filesystem. By default they are put in the system temporary directory with a prefix of `config-repo-`. On linux, for example it could be `/tmp/config-repo-<randomid>`. Some operating systems http://serverfault.com/questions/377348/when-does-tmp-get-cleared/377349#377349[routinely clean out] temporary directories. This can lead to unexpected behaviour such as missing properties. To avoid this problem, change the directory Config Server uses, by setting `spring.cloud.config.server.git.basedir` or `spring.cloud.config.server.svn.basedir` to a directory that does not reside in the system temp structure.

==== File System Backend

There is also a "native" profile in the Config Server that doesn't use
Git, but just loads the config files from the local classpath or file
system (any static URL you want to point to with
"spring.cloud.config.server.native.searchLocations"). To use the
native profile just launch the Config Server with
"spring.profiles.active=native". 

NOTE: Remember to use the `file:` prefix for file resources (the
default without a prefix is usually the classpath). Just as with any
Spring Boot configuration you can embed `${}`-style environment
placeholders, but remember that absolute paths in Windows require an
extra "/", e.g. `file:///${user.home}/config-repo`

WARNING: The default value of the `searchLocations` is identical to a
local Spring Boot application (so `[classpath:/, classpath:/config,
file:./, file:./config]`). This does not expose the
`application.properties` from the server to all clients because any
property sources present in the server are removed before being sent
to the client.

TIP: A filesystem backend is great for getting started quickly and
for testing. To use it in production you need to be sure that the 
file system is reliable, and shared across all instances of the
Config Server.

The search locations can contain placeholders for `{application}`,
`{profile}` and `{label}`. In this way you can segregate the
directories in the path, and choose a strategy that makes sense for
you (e.g. sub-directory per application, or sub-directory per
profile).

If you don't use placeholders in the search locations, this repository
also appends the `{label}` parameter of the HTTP resource to a suffix
on the search path, so properties files are loaded from each search
location *and* a subdirectory with the same name as the label (the
labelled properties take precedence in the Spring Environment). Thus
the default behaviour with no placeholders is the same as adding a
search location ending with `/{label}/. For example `file:/tmp/config`
is the same as `file:/tmp/config,file:/tmp/config/{label}`

==== Sharing Configuration With All Applications

With file-based (i.e. git, svn and native) repositories, resources
with file names in `application*` are shared between all client
applications (so `application.properties`, `application.yml`,
`application-*.properties` etc.). You can use resources with these
file names to configure global defaults and have them overridden by
application-specific files as necessary.

The #_property_overrides[property overrides] feature can also be used
for setting global defaults, and with placeholders applications are
allowed to override them locally.

TIP: With the "native" profile (local file system backend) it is
recommended that you use an explicit search location that isn't part
of the server's own configuration. Otherwise the `application*`
resources in the default search locations are removed because they are
part of the server.

==== Property Overrides

The Config Server has an "overrides" feature that allows the operator
to provide configuration properties to all applications that cannot be
accidentally changed by the application using the normal Spring Boot
hooks. To declare overrides just add a map of name-value pairs to
`spring.cloud.config.server.overrides`. For example

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        overrides:
          foo: bar
----

will cause all applications that are config clients to read `foo=bar`
independent of their own configuration. (Of course an application can
use the data in the Config Server in any way it likes, so overrides
are not enforceable, but they do provide useful default behaviour if
they are Spring Cloud Config clients.)

TIP: Normal, Spring environment placeholders with "${}" can be escaped
(and resolved on the client) by using backslash ("\") to escape the
"$" or the "{", e.g. `\${app.foo:bar}` resolves to "bar" unless the
app provides its own "app.foo". Note that in YAML you don't need to
escape the backslash itself, but in properties files you do, when you
configure the overrides on the server.

You can change the priority of all overrides in the client to be more
like default values, allowing applications to supply their own values
in environment variables or System properties, by setting the flag `

=== Health Indicator

Config Server comes with a Health Indicator that checks if the configured
`EnvironmentRepository` is working.  By default it asks the `EnvironmentRepository`
for an application named `app`, the `default` profile and the default
label provided by the `EnvironmentRepository` implementation.

You can configure the Health Indicator to check more applications
along with custom profiles and custom labels, e.g.

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        health:
          repositories:
            myservice:
              label: mylabel
            myservice-dev:
              name: myservice
              profiles: development
----

You can disable the Health Indicator by setting `spring.cloud.config.server.health.enabled=false`.

=== Security

You are free to secure your Config Server in any way that makes sense
to you (from physical network security to OAuth2 bearer
tokens), and Spring Security and Spring Boot make it easy to do pretty
much anything. 

To use the default Spring Boot configured HTTP Basic security, just
include Spring Security on the classpath (e.g. through
`spring-boot-starter-security`). The default is a username of "user"
and a randomly generated password, which isn't going to be very useful
in practice, so we recommend you configure the password (via
`security.user.password`) and encrypt it (see below for instructions
on how to do that).

=== Encryption and Decryption

IMPORTANT: **Prerequisites:** to use the encryption and decryption features
you need the full-strength JCE installed in your JVM (it's not there by default).
You can download the "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files"
from Oracle, and follow instructions for installation (essentially replace the 2 policy files
in the JRE lib/security directory with the ones that you downloaded).

If the remote property sources contain encrypted content (values
starting with `{cipher}`) they will be decrypted before sending to
clients over HTTP. The main advantage of this set up is that the
property values don't have to be in plain text when they are "at rest"
(e.g. in a git repository). If a value cannot be decrypted it is
removed from the property source and an additional property is added
with the same key, but prefixed with "invalid." and a value that means
"not applicable" (usually "<n/a>"). This is largely to prevent cipher
text being used as a password and accidentally leaking.

If you are setting up a remote config repository for config client
applications it might contain an `application.yml` like this, for
instance:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  datasource:
    username: dbuser
    password: '{cipher}FKSAJDFGYOS8F7GLHAKERGFHLSAJ'
----

Encrypted values in a .properties file must not be wrapped in quotes, otherwise the value will not be decrypted:

.application.properties
----
spring.datasource.username: dbuser
spring.datasource.password: {cipher}FKSAJDFGYOS8F7GLHAKERGFHLSAJ
----

You can safely push this plain text to a shared git repository and the
secret password is protected.

The server also exposes `/encrypt` and `/decrypt` endpoints (on the
assumption that these will be secured and only accessed by authorized
agents). If you are editing a remote config file you can use the Config Server
to encrypt values by POSTing to the `/encrypt` endpoint, e.g.

----
$ curl localhost:8888/encrypt -d mysecret
682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
----

The inverse operation is also available via `/decrypt` (provided the server is
configured with a symmetric key or a full key pair):

----
$ curl localhost:8888/decrypt -d 682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
mysecret
----

TIP: If you are testing like this with curl, then use
`--data-urlencode` (instead of `-d`) or set an explicit `Content-Type:
text/plain` to make sure curl encodes the data correctly when there
are special characters ('+' is particularly tricky).

Take the encrypted value and add the `{cipher}` prefix before you put
it in the YAML or properties file, and before you commit and push it
to a remote, potentially insecure store. 

The `/encrypt` and `/decrypt` endpoints also both accept paths of the
form `/*/{name}/{profiles}` which can be used to control cryptography
per application (name) and profile when clients call into the main
Environment resource.

NOTE: to control the cryptography in this granular way you must also 
provide a `@Bean` of type `TextEncryptorLocator` that creates a
different encryptor per name and profiles. The one that is provided
by default does not do this (so all encryptions use the same key).

The `spring` command line client (with Spring Cloud CLI extensions
installed) can also be used to encrypt and decrypt, e.g.

----
$ spring encrypt mysecret --key foo
682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
$ spring decrypt --key foo 682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
mysecret
----

To use a key in a file (e.g. an RSA public key for encryption) prepend
the key value with "@" and provide the file path, e.g.

----
$ spring encrypt mysecret --key @${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
AQAjPgt3eFZQXwt8tsHAVv/QHiY5sI2dRcR+...
----

The key argument is mandatory (despite having a `--` prefix).

=== Key Management

The Config Server can use a symmetric (shared) key or an asymmetric
one (RSA key pair). The asymmetric choice is superior in terms of
security, but it is often more convenient to use a symmetric key since
it is just a single property value to configure.

To configure a symmetric key you just need to set `encrypt.key` to a
secret String (or use an enviroment variable `ENCRYPT_KEY` to keep it
out of plain text configuration files).

To configure an asymmetric key you can either set the key as a
PEM-encoded text value (in `encrypt.key`), or via a keystore (e.g. as
created by the `keytool` utility that comes with the JDK). The
keystore properties are `encrypt.keyStore.\*` with `*` equal to

* `location` (a `Resource` location), 
* `password` (to unlock the keystore) and 
* `alias` (to identify which key in the store is to be
used).

The encryption is done with the public key, and a private key is
needed for decryption. Thus in principle you can configure only the
public key in the server if you only want to do encryption (and are
prepared to decrypt the values yourself locally with the private
key). In practice you might not want to do that because it spreads the
key management process around all the clients, instead of
concentrating it in the server. On the other hand it's a useful option
if your config server really is relatively insecure and only a
handful of clients need the encrypted properties.

=== Creating a Key Store for Testing

To create a keystore for testing you can do something like this:

----
$ keytool -genkeypair -alias mytestkey -keyalg RSA \
  -dname "CN=Web Server,OU=Unit,O=Organization,L=City,S=State,C=US" \
  -keypass changeme -keystore server.jks -storepass letmein
----

Put the `server.jks` file in the classpath (for instance) and then in
your `application.yml` for the Config Server:

[source,yaml]
----
encrypt:
  keyStore:
    location: classpath:/server.jks
    password: letmein
    alias: mytestkey
    secret: changeme
----

=== Using Multiple Keys and Key Rotation

In addition to the `{cipher}` prefix in encrypted property values, the
Config Server looks for `{name:value}` prefixes (zero or many) before
the start of the (Base64 encoded) cipher text. The keys are passed to
a `TextEncryptorLocator` which can do whatever logic it needs to
locate a `TextEncryptor` for the cipher. If you have configured a
keystore (`encrypt.keystore.location`) the default locator will look
for keys in the store with aliases as supplied by the "key" prefix,
i.e. with a cipher text like this:

[source,yaml]
----
foo:
  bar: `{cipher}{key:testkey}...`
----

the locator will look for a key named "testkey". A secret can also be
supplied via a `{secret:...}` value in the prefix, but if it is not
the default is to use the keystore password (which is what you get
when you build a keytore and don't specify a secret). If you *do*
supply a secret it is recommended that you also encrypt the secrets
using a custom `SecretLocator`.

Key rotation is hardly ever necessary on cryptographic grounds if the
keys are only being used to encrypt a few bytes of configuration data
(i.e. they are not being used elsewhere), but occasionally you might
need to change the keys if there is a security breach for instance. In
that case all the clients would need to change their source config
files (e.g. in git) and use a new `{key:...}` prefix in all the
ciphers, checking beforehand of course that the key alias is available
in the Config Server keystore.

TIP: the `{name:value}` prefixes can also be added to plaintext posted
to the `/encrypt` endpoint, if you want to let the Config Server
handle all encryption as well as decryption.

=== Serving Encrypted Properties

Sometimes you want the clients to decrypt the configuration locally,
instead of doing it in the server. In that case you can still have
/encrypt and /decrypt endpoints (if you provide the `encrypt.*`
configuration to locate a key), but you need to explicitly switch off
the decryption of outgoing properties using
`spring.cloud.config.server.encrypt.enabled=false`. If you don't care
about the endpoints, then it should work if you configure neither the
key nor the enabled flag.

== Serving Alternative Formats

The default JSON format from the environment endpoints is perfect for
consumption by Spring applications because it maps directly onto the
`Environment` abstraction. If you prefer you can consume the same data
as YAML or Java properties by adding a suffix to the resource path
(".yml", ".yaml" or ".properties"). This can be useful for consumption
by applications that do not care about the structure of the JSON
endpoints, or the extra metadata they provide, for example an
application that is not using Spring might benefit from the simplicity
of this approach.

The YAML and properties representations have an additional flag
(provided as a boolean query parameter `resolvePlaceholders`) to
signal that placeholders in the source documents, in the standard
Spring `${...}` form, should be resolved in the output where possible
before rendering. This is a useful feature for consumers that don't
know about the Spring placeholder conventions.

NOTE: there are limitations in using the YAML or properties formats,
mainly in relation to the loss of metadata. The JSON is structured as
an ordered list of property sources, for example, with names that
correlate with the source. The YAML and properties forms are coalesced
into a single map, even if the origin of the values has multiple
sources, and the names of the original source files are lost. The YAML
representation is not necessarily a faithful representation of the
YAML source in a backing repository either: it is constructed from a
list of flat property sources, and assumptions have to be made about
the form of the keys.

== Serving Plain Text

Instead of using the `Environment` abstraction (or one of the
alternative representations of it in YAML or properties format) your
applications might need generic plain text configuration files,
tailored to their environment. The Config Server provides these
through an additional endpoint at `/{name}/{profile}/{label}/{path}`
where "name", "profile" and "label" have the same meaning as the
regular environment endpoint, but "path" is a file name
(e.g. `log.xml`). The source files for this endpoint are located in
the same way as for the environment endpoints: the same search path is
used as for properties or YAML files, but instead of aggregating all
matching resources, only the first one to match is returned.

After a resource is located, placeholders in the normal format
(`${...}`) are resolved using the effective `Environment` for the
application name, profile and label supplied. In this way the resource
endpoint is tightly integrated with the environment
endpoints. Example, if you have this layout for a GIT (or SVN)
repository:

----
application.yml
nginx.conf
----

where `nginx.conf` looks like this:

----
server {
    listen              80;
    server_name         ${nginx.server.name};
}
----

and `application.yml` like this:

[source,yaml]
----
nginx:
  server:
    name: example.com
---
spring:
  profiles: development
nginx:
  server:
    name: develop.com
----

then the `/foo/default/master/nginx.conf` resource looks like this:

----
server {
    listen              80;
    server_name         example.com;
}
----

and `/foo/development/master/nginx.conf` like this:

----
server {
    listen              80;
    server_name         develop.com;
}
----

NOTE: just like the source files for environment configuration, the
"profile" is used to resolve the file name, so if you want a
profile-specific file then `/\*/development/*/logback.xml` will be
resolved by a file called `logback-development.xml` (in preference
to `logback.xml`).

== Embedding the Config Server

The Config Server runs best as a standalone application, but if you
need to you can embed it in another application. Just use the
`@EnableConfigServer` annotation. An optional property that can be
useful in this case is `spring.cloud.config.server.bootstrap` which is
a flag to indicate that the server should configure itself from its
own remote repository. The flag is off by default because it can delay
startup, but when embedded in another application it makes sense to
initialize the same way as any other application.

NOTE: It should be obvious, but remember that if you use the bootstrap
flag the config server will need to have its name and repository URI
configured in `bootstrap.yml`.

To change the location of the server endpoints you can (optionally)
set `spring.cloud.config.server.prefix`, e.g. "/config", to serve the
resources under a prefix. The prefix should start but not end with a
"/". It is applied to the `@RequestMappings` in the Config Server
(i.e. underneath the Spring Boot prefixes `server.servletPath` and
`server.contextPath`).

If you want to read the configuration for an application directly from
the backend repository (instead of from the config server) that's
basically an embedded config server with no endpoints. You can switch
off the endpoints entirely if you don't use the `@EnableConfigServer`
annotation (just set `spring.cloud.config.server.bootstrap=true`).

== Push Notifications and Spring Cloud Bus

Many source code repository providers (like Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket
for instance) will notify you of changes in a repository through a
webhook. You can configure the webhook via the provider's user
interface as a URL and a set of events in which you are
interested. For instance
https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pushevent[Github]
will POST to the webhook with a JSON body containing a list of
commits, and a header "X-Github-Event" equal to "push". If you add a
dependency on the `spring-cloud-config-monitor` library and activate
the Spring Cloud Bus in your Config Server, then a "/monitor" endpoint
is enabled.

When the webhook is activated the Config Server will send a
`RefreshRemoteApplicationEvent` targeted at the applications it thinks
might have changed. The change detection can be strategized, but by
default it just looks for changes in files that match the application
name (e.g. "foo.properties" is targeted at the "foo" application, and
"application.properties" is targeted at all applications). The strategy
if you want to override the behaviour is `PropertyPathNotificationExtractor`
which accepts the request headers and body as parameters and returns a list
of file paths that changed.

The default configuration works out of the box with Github, Gitlab or
Bitbucket. In addition to the JSON notifications from Github, Gitlab
or Bitbucket you can trigger a change notification by POSTing to
"/monitor" with a form-encoded body parameters `path={name}`. This will
broadcast to applications matching the "{name}" pattern (can contain
wildcards).

NOTE: the `RefreshRemoteApplicationEvent` will only be transmitted if
the `spring-cloud-bus` is activated in the Config Server and in the
client application.

NOTE: the default configuration also detects filesystem changes in
local git repositories (the webhook is not used in that case but as
soon as you edit a config file a refresh will be broadcast).

== Spring Cloud Config Client

A Spring Boot application can take immediate advantage of the Spring
Config Server (or other external property sources provided by the
application developer), and it will also pick up some additional
useful features related to `Environment` change events.

[[config-first-bootstrap]]
=== Config First Bootstrap

This is the default behaviour for any application which has the Spring
Cloud Config Client on the classpath. When a config client starts up
it binds to the Config Server (via the bootstrap configuration
property `spring.cloud.config.uri`) and initializes Spring
`Environment` with remote property sources.

The net result of this is that all client apps that want to consume
the Config Server need a `bootstrap.yml` (or an environment variable)
with the server address in `spring.cloud.config.uri` (defaults to
"http://localhost:8888").

[[discovery-first-bootstrap]]
=== Discovery First Bootstrap

If you are using a `DiscoveryClient implementation, such as Spring Cloud Netflix
and Eureka Service Discovery or Spring Cloud Consul (Spring Cloud Zookeeper does
not support this yet), then you can have the Config Server register with the
Discovery Service if you want to, but in the default "Config First" mode,
clients won't be able to take advantage of the registration.

If you prefer to use `DiscoveryClient` to locate the Config Server, you can do
that by setting `spring.cloud.config.discovery.enabled=true` (default
"false"). The net result of that is that client apps all need a
`bootstrap.yml` (or an environment variable) with the appropriate discovery
configuration. For example, with Spring Cloud Netflix, you need to define the
Eureka server address, e.g. in `eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone`.  The
price for using this option is an extra network round trip on start up to
locate the service registration. The benefit is that the Config Server
can change its co-ordinates, as long as the Discovery Service is a fixed point. The
default service id is "configserver" but you can change that on the
client with `spring.cloud.config.discovery.serviceId` (and on the server
in the usual way for a service, e.g. by setting `spring.application.name`).

The discovery client implementations all support some kind of metadata
map (e.g. for Eureka we have `eureka.instance.metadataMap`). Some
additional properties of the Config Server may need to be configured
in its service registration metadata so that clients can connect
correctly. If the Config Server is secured with HTTP Basic you can
configure the credentials as "username" and "password". And if the
Config Server has a context path you can set "configPath". Example,
for a Config Server that is a Eureka client:

.bootstrap.yml
[source,yaml]
----
eureka:
  instance:
    ...
    metadataMap:
      user: osufhalskjrtl
      password: lviuhlszvaorhvlo5847
      configPath: /config
----


[[config-client-fail-fast]]
=== Config Client Fail Fast

In some cases, it may be desirable to fail startup of a service if
it cannot connect to the Config Server.  If this is the desired
behavior, set the bootstrap configuration property
`spring.cloud.config.failFast=true` and the client will halt with
an Exception.

[[config-client-retry]]
=== Config Client Retry

If you expect that the config server may occasionally be unavailable when
your app starts, you can ask it to keep trying after a failure. First you need 
to set `spring.cloud.config.failFast=true`, and then you need to add
`spring-retry` and `spring-boot-starter-aop` to your classpath. The default
behaviour is to retry 6 times with an initial backoff interval of 1000ms and an
exponential multiplier of 1.1 for subsequent backoffs. You can configure these
properties (and others) using `spring.cloud.config.retry.*` configuration properties.

TIP: To take full control of the retry add a `@Bean` of type
`RetryOperationsInterceptor` with id "configServerRetryInterceptor". Spring
Retry has a `RetryInterceptorBuilder` that makes it easy to create one.

=== Locating Remote Configuration Resources

The Config Service serves property sources from `/{name}/{profile}/{label}`, where the default bindings in the client app are

* "name" = `${spring.application.name}`
* "profile" = `${spring.profiles.active}` (actually `Environment.getActiveProfiles()`)
* "label" = "master"

All of them can be overridden by setting `spring.cloud.config.\*`
(where `*` is "name", "profile" or "label"). The "label" is useful for
rolling back to previous versions of configuration; with the default
Config Server implementation it can be a git label, branch name or
commit id. Label can also be provided as a comma-separated list, in 
which case the items in the list are tried on-by-one until one succeeds.
This can be useful when working on a feature branch, for instance,
when you might want to align the config label with your branch, but 
make it optional (e.g. `spring.cloud.config.label=myfeature,develop`).

=== Security

If you use HTTP Basic security on the server then clients just need to
know the password (and username if it isn't the default). You can do
that via the config server URI, or via separate username and password
properties, e.g.

.bootstrap.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
     uri: https://user:secret@myconfig.mycompany.com
----

or

.bootstrap.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
     uri: https://myconfig.mycompany.com
     username: user
     password: secret
----

The `spring.cloud.config.password` and `spring.cloud.config.username`
values override anything that is provided in the URI.

If you deploy your apps on Cloud Foundry then the best way to provide
the password is through service credentials, e.g. in the URI, since
then it doesn't even need to be in a config file. An example which
works locally and for a user-provided service on Cloud Foundry named
"configserver":

.bootstrap.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
     uri: ${vcap.services.configserver.credentials.uri:http://user:password@localhost:8888}

----

If you use another form of security you might need to provide a
`RestTemplate` to the `ConfigServicePropertySourceLocator` (e.g. by
grabbing it in the bootstrap context and injecting one).
