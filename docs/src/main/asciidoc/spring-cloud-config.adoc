== Spring Cloud Config Server

The Server provides an HTTP, resource-based API for external
configuration (name-value pairs, or equivalent YAML content).  The
server is easily embeddable in a Spring Boot application using the
`@EnableConfigServer` annotation.

=== Environment Repository

Where do you want to store the configuration data for the Config
Server? The strategy that governs this behaviour is the
`EnvironmentRepository`, serving `Environment` objects. This
`Environment` is a shallow copy of the domain from the Spring
`Environment` (including `propertySources` as the main feature). The
`Environment` resources are parametrized by three variables:


* `{application}` maps to "spring.application.name" on the client side;

* `{profile}` maps to "spring.active.profiles" on the client (comma separated list); and 

* `{label}` which is a server side feature labelling a "versioned" set of config files.

Repository implementations generally behave just like a Spring Boot
application loading configuration files from a "spring.config.name"
equal to the `{application}` parameter, and "spring.profiles.active"
equal to the `{profiles}` parameter. Precedence rules for profiles are
also the same as in a regular Boot application: active profiles take
precedence over defaults, and if there are multiple profiles the last
one wins (like adding entries to a `Map`).

Example: a client application has this bootstrap configuration:

.bootstrap.yml
----
spring:
  application:
    name: foo
  profiles:
    active: dev,mysql
----

(as usual with a Spring Boot application, these properties could also
be set as environment variables or command line arguments). 

If the repository is file-based, the server will create an
`Environment` from `application.yml` (shared between all clients), and
`foo.yml` (with `foo.yml` taking precedence). If the YAML files have
documents inside them that point to Spring profiles, those are applied
with higher precendence (in order of the profiles listed), and if
there are profile-specific YAML (or properties) files these are also
applied with higher precedence than the defaults. Higher precendence
translates to a `PropertySource` listed earlier in the
`Environment`. (These are the same rules as apply in a standalone
Spring Boot application.)

==== Git Backend

The default implementation of `EnvironmentRepository` uses a Git
backend, which is very convenient for managing upgrades and physical
environments, and also for auditing changes. To change the location of
the repository you can set the "spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri"
configuration property in the Config Server (e.g. in
`application.yml`). If you set it with a `file:` prefix it should work
from a local repository so you can get started quickly and easily
without a server, but in that case the server operates directly on the
local repository without cloning it (it doesn't matter if it's not
bare because the Config Server never makes changes to the "remote"
repository). To scale the Config Server up and make it highly
available, you would need to have all instances of the server pointing
to the same repository, so only a shared file system would work. Even
in that case it is better to use the `ssh:` protocol for a shared
filesystem repository, so that the server can clone it and use a local
working copy as a cache.

This repository implementation maps the `{label}` parameter of the
HTTP resource to a git label (commit id, branch name or tag).

Spring Cloud Config Server supports a single or multiple git
repositories:

----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          repos:
            simple: https://github.com/pattern1/config-repo
            special:
              pattern: pattern*,*pattern1*
              uri: https://github.com/pattern2/config-repo
            local:
              pattern: local*
              uri: file:/home/configsvc/config-repo
----

In the above example, if {application} does not match to any of the
patterns, it will use the default uri defined under
"spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri". For the "simple" repository, the
pattern is "simple" (i.e. it only matches one application).  The
pattern format is a comma-separated list of application names with
wildcards.

Every repository can also optionally store config files in
sub-directories, and patterns to search for those directories can be
specified as `searchPaths`. For example at the top level:

----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          searchPaths: foo,bar*
----

In this example the server searches for config files in the top level
and in the "foo/" sub-directory and also any sub-directory whose name
begins with "bar".

By default the server clones remote repositories when configuration 
is first requested. The server can be configured to clone the repositories
at startup. For example at the top level:

----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://git/common/config-repo.git
          repos:
            team-a:
                pattern: team-a-*
                cloneOnStart: true
                uri: http://git/team-a/config-repo.git
            team-b:
                pattern: team-b-*
                cloneOnStart: false
                uri: http://git/team-b/config-repo.git
            team-c:
                pattern: team-c-*
                uri: http://git/team-a/config-repo.git
                
----

In this example the server clones team-a's config-repo on startup before it 
accepts any requests. All other repositories will not be cloned until 
configuration from the repository is requested.

To use HTTP basic authentication on the remote repository add the
"username" and "password" properties separately (not in the URL), 
e.g.

----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo
          username: trolley
          password: strongpassword
----

If you don't use HTTPS and user credentials, SSH should also work out
of the box when you store keys in the default directories (`~/.ssh`)
and the uri points to an SSH location,
e.g. "git@github.com:configuration/cloud-configuration". The
repository is accessed using JGit, so any documentation you find on
that should be applicable.

==== File System Backend

There is also a "native" profile in the Config Server that doesn't use
Git, but just loads the config files from the local classpath or file
system (any static URL you want to point to with
"spring.cloud.config.server.native.searchLocations"). To use the native
profile just launch the Config Server with
"spring.profiles.active=native".

WARNING: The default value of the `searchLocations` is identical to a
local Spring Boot application (so
`[classpath:/, classpath:/config, file:./, file:./config]`) which will
expose the `application.properties` from the server to all clients.

TIP: A filesystem backend is great for getting started quickly and
for testing. To use it in production you need to be sure that the 
file system is reliable, and shared across all instances of the
Config Server.

This repository implementation maps the `{label}` parameter of the
HTTP resource to a suffix on the search path, so properties files are
loaded from each search location *and* a subdirectory with the same
name as the label (the labelled properties take precedence in the
Spring Environment).

=== Health Indicator

Config Server comes with a Health Indicator that checks if the configured
`EnvironmentRepository` is working.  By default it asks the `EnvironmentRepository`
for an application named `app`, the `default` profile and the default
label provided by the `EnvironmentRepository` implementation.

You can configure the Health Indicator to check more applications
along with custom profiles and custom labels, e.g.

----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        health:
          repositories:
            myservice:
              label: mylabel
            myservice-dev:
              name: myservice
              profiles: development
----

You can disable the Health Indicator by setting `spring.cloud.config.server.health.enabled=false`.

=== Security

You are free to secure your Config Server in any way that makes sense
to you (from physical network security to OAuth2 bearer
tokens), and Spring Security and Spring Boot make it easy to do pretty
much anything. 

To use the default Spring Boot configured HTTP Basic security, just
include Spring Security on the classpath (e.g. through
`spring-boot-starter-security`). The default is a username of "user"
and a randomly generated password, which isn't going to be very useful
in practice, so we recommend you configure the password (via
`security.user.password`) and encrypt it (see below for instructions
on how to do that).

=== Encryption and Decryption

IMPORTANT: **Prerequisites:** to use the encryption and decryption features
you need the full-strength JCE installed in your JVM (it's not there by default).
You can download the "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files"
from Oracle, and follow instructions for installation (essentially replace the 2 policy files
in the JRE lib/security directory with the ones that you downloaded).

The server exposes `/encrypt` and `/decrypt` endpoints (on the
assumption that these will be secured and only accessed by authorized
agents). If the remote property sources contain encryted content
(values starting with `{cipher}`) they will be decrypted before
sending to clients over HTTP. The main advantage of this set up is
that the property values don't have to be in plain text when they are
"at rest" (e.g. in a git repository). If a value cannot be decrypted
it is replaced with an empty string, largely to prevent cipher text
being used as a password in Spring Boot autconfigured HTTP basic.

If you are setting up a remote config repository for config client
applications it might contain an `application.yml` like this, for
instance:

.application.yml
----
spring:
  datasource:
    username: dbuser
    password: '{cipher}FKSAJDFGYOS8F7GLHAKERGFHLSAJ'
----

You can safely push this plain text to a shared git repository and the
secret password is protected.

If you are editing a remote config file you can use the Config Server
to encrypt values by POSTing to the `/encrypt` endpoint, e.g.

----
$ curl localhost:8888/encrypt -d mysecret
682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
----

The inverse operation is also available via `/decrypt` (provided the server is
configured with a symmetric key or a full key pair):

----
$ curl localhost:8888/decrypt -d 682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
mysecret
----

Take the encypted value and add the `{cipher}` prefix before you put
it in the YAML or properties file, and before you commit and push it
to a remote, potentially insecure store.

The `spring` command line client (with Spring Cloud CLI extensions
installed) can also be used to encrypt and decrypt, e.g.

----
$ spring encrypt mysecret --key foo
682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
$ spring decrypt --key foo 682bc583f4641835fa2db009355293665d2647dade3375c0ee201de2a49f7bda
mysecret
----

To use a key in a file (e.g. an RSA public key for encyption) prepend
the key value with "@" and provide the file path, e.g.

----
$ spring encrypt mysecret --key @${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
AQAjPgt3eFZQXwt8tsHAVv/QHiY5sI2dRcR+...
----

The key argument is mandatory (despite having a `--` prefix).

=== Key Management

The Config Server can use a symmetric (shared) key or an asymmetric
one (RSA key pair). The asymmetric choice is superior in terms of
security, but it is often more convenient to use a symmetric key since
it is just a single property value to configure.

To configure a symmetric key you just need to set `encrypt.key` to a
secret String (or use an enviroment variable `ENCRYPT_KEY` to keep it
out of plain text configuration files). You can also POST a key value
to the `/key` endpoint (but that won't change any existing encrypted
values in remote repositories).

To configure an asymmetric key you can either set the key as a
PEM-encoded text value (in `encrypt.key`), or via a keystore (e.g. as
created by the `keytool` utility that comes with the JDK). The
keystore properties are `encrypt.keyStore.\*` with `*` equal to

* `location` (a `Resource` location), 
* `password` (to unlock the keystore) and 
* `alias` (to identify which key in the store is to be
used).

The encryption is done with the public key, and a private key is
needed for decryption. Thus in principle you can configure only the
public key in the server if you only want to do encryption (and are
prepared to decrypt the values yourself locally with the private
key). In practice you might not want to do that because it spreads the
key management process around all the clients, instead of
concentrating it in the server. On the other hand it's a useful option
if your config server really is relatively insecure and only a
handful of clients need the encrypted properties.

=== Creating a Key Store for Testing

To create a keystore for testing you can do something like this:

----
$ keytool -genkeypair -alias mytestkey -keyalg RSA \
  -dname "CN=Web Server,OU=Unit,O=Organization,L=City,S=State,C=US" \
  -keypass changeme -keystore server.jks -storepass letmein
----

Put the `server.jks` file in the classpath (for instance) and then in
your `application.yml` for the Config Server:

----
encrypt:
  keyStore:
    location: classpath:/server.jks
    password: letmein
    alias: mytestkey
    secret: changeme
----

=== Embedding the Config Server

The Config Server runs best as a standalone application, but if you
need to you can embed it in another application. Just use the
`@EnableConfigServer` annotation and (optionally) set
`spring.cloud.config.server.prefix` to a path prefix, e.g. "/config",
to serve the resources under a prefix. The prefix should start but not
end with a "/". It is applied to the `@RequestMappings` in the Config
Server (i.e. underneath the Spring Boot prefixes `server.servletPath`
and `server.contextPath`). Another optional property that can be
useful in this case is `spring.cloud.config.server.bootstrap` which is
a flag to indicate that the server should configure itself from its
own remote repository. The flag is off by default because it can delay
startup, but when embedded in another application it makes sense to
initialize the same way as any other application.

== Spring Cloud Config Client

A Spring Boot application can take immediate advantage of the Spring
Config Server (or other external property sources provided by the
application developer), and it will also pick up some additional
useful features related to `Environment` change events.

[[config-first-bootstrap]]
=== Config First Bootstrap

This is the default behaviour for any application which has the Spring
Cloud Config Client on the classpath. When a config client starts up
it binds to the Config Server (via the bootstrap configuration
property `spring.cloud.config.uri`) and initializes Spring
`Environment` with remote property sources.

The net result of this is that all client apps that want to consume
the Config Server need a `bootstrap.yml` (or an environment variable)
with the server address in `spring.cloud.config.uri` (defaults to
"http://localhost:8888").

[[eureka-first-bootstrap]]
=== Eureka First Bootstrap

If you are using Spring Cloud Netflix and Eureka Service Discovery,
then you can have the Config Server register with Eureka if you want
to, but in the default "Config First" mode, clients won't be able to
take advantage of the registration.

If you prefer to use Eureka to locate the Config Server, you can do
that by setting `spring.cloud.config.discovery.enabled=true` (default
"false"). The net result of that is that client apps all need a
`bootstrap.yml` (or an environment variable) with the Eureka server
address, e.g. in `eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone`.  The price
for using this option is an extra network round trip on start up to
locate the service registration. The benefit is that the Config Server
can change its co-ordinates, as long as Eureka is a fixed point. The
default service id is "CONFIGSERVER" but you can change that on the
client with `spring.cloud.config.discovery.serviceId` (and on the server
in the usual way for a service, e.g. by setting `spring.application.name`).

[[config-client-fail-fast]]
=== Config Client Fail Fast

In some cases, it may be desirable to fail startup of a service if
it cannot connect to the Config Server.  If this is the desired
behavior, set the bootstrap configuration property
`spring.cloud.config.failFast=true` and the client will halt with
an Exception.

=== Locating Remote Configuration Resources

The Config Service serves property sources from `/{name}/{env}/{label}`, where the default bindings in the client app are

* "name" = `${spring.application.name}`
* "env" = `${spring.profiles.active}` (actually `Environment.getActiveProfiles()`)
* "label" = "master"

All of them can be overridden by setting `spring.cloud.config.\*`
(where `*` is "name", "env" or "label"). The "label" is useful for
rolling back to previous versions of configuration; with the default
Config Server implementation it can be a git label, branch name or
commit id. Label can also be provided as a comma-separated list, in 
which case the items in the list are tried on-by-one until one succeeds.
This can be useful when working on a feature branch, for instance,
when you might want to align the config label with your branch, but 
make it optional (e.g. `spring.cloud.config.label=myfeature,develop`).

=== Security

If you use HTTP Basic security on the server then clients just need to
know the password (and username if it isn't the default). You can do
that via the config server URI, or via separate username and password
properties, e.g.

.bootstrap.yml
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
     uri: https://user:secret@myconfig.mycompany.com
----

or

.bootstrap.yml
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
     uri: https://myconfig.mycompany.com
     username: user
     password: secret
----

The `spring.cloud.config.password` and `spring.cloud.config.username`
values override anything that is provided in the URI.

If you deploy your apps on Cloud Foundry then the best way to provide
the password is through service credentials, e.g. in the URI, since
then it doesn't even need to be in a config file. An example which
works locally and for a user-provided service on Cloud Foundry named
"configserver":

.bootstrap.yml
----
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
     uri: ${vcap.services.configserver.credentials.uri:http://user:password@localhost:8888}

----

If you use another form of security you might need to provide a
`RestTemplate` to the `ConfigServicePropertySourceLocator` (e.g. by
grabbing it in the bootstrap context and injecting one).
